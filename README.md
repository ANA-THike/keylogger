# keylogger
This Python program functions as a keylogger, capturing keystrokes on the system. Once compiled into an executable (.exe), it stores the captured keystrokes and sends the data to your Telegram bot every 30 minutes. You can adjust the time interval as needed, and the program runs in the background.
