# Keylogger with Telegram Bot Integration

This Python program functions as a keylogger, capturing keystrokes from the system and sending the captured data to your Telegram bot at a set interval (default: every 30 minutes). The program can be compiled into an executable (.exe) and runs in the background.

> **Disclaimer**: This project is for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical. Do not use it without explicit consent.

## Features

- Captures keystrokes from the system.
- Sends captured data to your Telegram bot every 30 minutes (interval adjustable).
- Runs in the background.
- Can be compiled into an executable (.exe).

## Requirements

Before using the program, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.x**: The programming language for the script.
- **`pyTelegramBotAPI`**: Library for interacting with the Telegram bot.
- **`pynput`**: Library for capturing keystrokes.
- **`pyinstaller`**: Tool to convert the Python script into an executable.

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pyTelegramBotAPI pynput pyinstaller
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Telegram Bot
- Go to BotFather on Telegram and create a new bot.
- After creation, you will get a bot token that you will need for the script.

### 2. Configure the Script
In the `keylogger.py` script, replace the following placeholders:

- `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN`: Replace this with your Telegram bot token.
- `YOUR_CHAT_ID`: Replace this with your chat ID (where the bot will send the messages).

To get your `chat_id`, you can send a message to your bot and use the `getUpdates` method to retrieve your chat ID.

### 3. Adjust Time Interval (Optional)
The default time interval for sending captured keystroke data to the bot is set to 30 minutes. You can adjust this by changing the `TIME_INTERVAL` variable in the script to your desired value.

## Running the Program
To run the program directly in Python, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `keylogger.py`.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
python keylogger.py
```

This will start the keylogger, and it will begin capturing keystrokes and sending them to your Telegram bot.

## Convert Python Script to Executable (.exe)
To convert your Python script into an executable file (.exe) for Windows, follow these steps. This allows you to run the keylogger without needing Python installed.

### Method 1: Using PyInstaller
1. **Install PyInstaller**: If you haven't already, install PyInstaller using pip:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

2. **Convert to Executable**: Use the PyInstaller command to convert your Python script into an executable. Open a terminal/command prompt, navigate to the directory where your script is located, and run the following command:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole keylogger.py
```

- `--onefile`: Creates a single executable file instead of a folder with multiple files.
- `--noconsole`: Hides the console window when the executable is running.

After the command finishes, you will find the `.exe` file in the `dist/` folder inside your project directory.

### Method 2: Using Python's `-m PyInstaller`
Alternatively, you can use Python’s `-m` flag to run PyInstaller:

1. **Install PyInstaller**: If you haven't installed PyInstaller yet, use the following command:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

2. **Convert to Executable**: You can use the following command with Python’s `-m` flag:

```bash
python -m PyInstaller --onefile --noconsole keylogger.py
```

This will generate an executable file in the `dist/` folder.

## After Conversion
Once the Python script is converted into an executable file, you can run the `.exe` directly, and it will function as described above:

- It will run in the background, capturing keystrokes and sending the data to your Telegram bot at the specified interval.

## Running the Executable
To run the program after it’s converted to an executable:

1. Navigate to the `dist/` folder.
2. Run the `keylogger.exe` file.

The program will run silently in the background, logging keystrokes and sending the data to your Telegram bot.
